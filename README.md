# IQDB Mobile Client
This app saves you a few clicks in situations like: you see an image on Facebook, you want to search it with IQDB. Instead of saving it to local storage, fire up an browser, navigate to IQDB and upload the image, now you just need to share the image from Facebook to this app. Quick and neat.
This app uses retrofit2 library and a couple of sample code snippets I found on the internet. 
I'm so lazy that I left the main UI blank. Search result is shown in a simple WebView. After all, all I need is to find the source of an image, so I just need a quick look at danbooru or sankakuchannel.
Feel free to recommend new behaviors or fork this project. The only part that worth your effort should be the part which execute multipart POST requests.
